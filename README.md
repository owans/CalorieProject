This project was given to me by the levelUp Academy to replicate as a way of memorizing the codebase and restructure the front-end of the calorie app.

1. At the end of the project, i should be able to code this app from scratch with little reference to the codebase.

2. Gain invaluable knowledge of how to build an app,including the control flow process.

3. Better my front-end skills
4. Scale the bootcamp live coding test
